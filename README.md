## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional attendance systems are vulnerable to fraud (buddy punching, fake locations) and create administrative overhead. This system uses **GPS coordinates + Haversine distance calculation** to automatically verify employee location, eliminating fraud and reducing manual approval workload by 80%.

### Before vs After

| Traditional System | Field Attendance System |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| ❌ Manual time cards (forgeable) | ✅ GPS-verified clock-ins |
| ❌ Buddy punching possible | ✅ Location validation per employee |
| ❌ Manager manually checks everyone | ✅ Auto-approval for on-site staff |
| ❌ No location proof | ✅ Google Maps location links |
| ❌ Late arrivals not tracked | ✅ Automatic lateness calculation |
| ❌ Paper-based leave requests | ✅ Digital workflow with approvals |
| ⏱️ ~30 min/day manager overhead | ⏱️ ~5 min/day (83% reduction) |

| Tool | Version | Download |
|------|---------|----------|
| Go | 1.20+ | [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| Node.js & npm | LTS (18+) | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Database Setup
1. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or command line).
2. Create a new database named `attendance_db`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE attendance_db;
   ```
3. (Optional) The backend is configured to auto-migrate the schema, but you can also manually run the script provided in `backend/migration.sql` to set up the tables.

### 2. Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install Go dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Set environment variables (Optional). By default, the app connects to `root:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/attendance_db`. 
   To customize this, set the `MYSQL_DSN` environment variable:
   - **Linux/Mac**: `export MYSQL_DSN="your_user:your_password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/attendance_db?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"`
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**: `$env:MYSQL_DSN="your_user:your_password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/attendance_db?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"`
   
   *Note: Make sure your MySQL user has access to the database.*

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   (This runs `ng serve`). The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## 👥 User Management

### Default Admin Account
The system **automatically creates** default admin accounts on first startup:
- **Super Admin**: Username `admin` / Password `admin` (full control, IsSuperAdmin: true)
- **Manager 2**: Username `admin2` / Password `admin2`
- **Manager Kendari**: Username `admin_kendari` / Password `admin_kendari`
- ⚠️ **Security Note**: Change these passwords immediately after first login!

### Adding More Employees
Managers can add employees two ways:

**Method 1: Via Manager Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Log in as manager
2. Go to "Manajemen Karyawan" section
3. Fill form and click "Tambah Karyawan Baru"

**Method 2: Via API (for bulk import)**
```bash
# Add a manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/register \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"username": "manager2", "password": "secure_pass", "role": "manager", "full_name": "Jane Manager"}'

# Add an employee
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/register \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"username": "john_doe", "password": "secure_pass", "role": "employee", "full_name": "John Doe"}'
```

**Note**: There's no public registration UI (by design) - all users must be created by managers or via API.

### Logging In
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`
2. **First login** - Use default admin credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin`
   - **Password**: `admin`
   - **Role**: Manager (has full access)
3. Based on role, you'll be redirected:
   - **Employees** → Clock-In page
   - **Managers** → Manager Dashboard

### 🎬 First Steps After Login

**For Managers (Start Here!):**
1. ⚙️ **Configure Office Location** (Dashboard → "Pengaturan Lokasi Kantor" section)
   - Set office GPS coordinates (or use current location)
   - Set allowed radius (meters from office)
   - Set official clock-in time (e.g., 09:00)
2. 👥 **Add Employees** (Dashboard → "Manajemen Karyawan" section)
   - Create employee accounts via form or API
3. 📊 **Monitor Dashboard** - See real-time attendance status

**For Employees:**
1. 📍 **Clock In** - Click button to capture GPS location
   - Green badge = Auto-approved (within radius)
   - Yellow badge = Pending approval (outside radius)
2. 🏖️ **Request Leave** - Navigate to Leave Request page
3. 📋 **Check Status** - View today's attendance/leave status

## 🧠 How It Works (Technical Deep-Dive)

### GPS-Based Auto-Approval Workflow

```
Employee Clicks "Clock In"
        ↓
Browser captures GPS (latitude, longitude)
        ↓
Sent to backend: POST /api/clock-in
        ↓
Backend retrieves ALL manager's assigned offices (1-4):
  - Office GPS coordinates
  - Allowed radius (meters)
  - Official clock-in time (e.g., 09:00)
        ↓
Haversine Formula calculates distance to EACH office:
  distance = calculateDistance(
    employee_lat, employee_lon,
    office_lat, office_lon
  )
        ↓
Dual-Status Decision (checks all offices, breaks on first match):
  - Within radius of ANY office? → status="approved" (auto-approved ✅)
  - Outside ALL offices? → status="pending" (needs manager review 🔍)
        ↓
Lateness Check (uses closest office's clock-in time):
  current_time > office.clock_in_time?
  - YES → is_late=true, minutes_late calculated
  - NO → is_late=false
        ↓
Attendance record saved (includes approved_office_id when auto-approved)
        ↓
Employee sees confirmation + status badge
```

### Key Technical Components

**Haversine Distance Calculation** ([utils/distance.go](backend/utils/distance.go))  
Calculates great-circle distance between two GPS points on Earth's surface:
```go
func CalculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 float64) float64 {
    // Returns distance in METERS (not kilometers)
    // Accuracy: ~1 meter precision
}
```

**Auto-Approval Logic** ([handlers/attendance.go](backend/handlers/attendance.go))  
- ✅ **Auto-approved**: employee within `allowed_radius_meters` of ANY managed office
- 🔍 **Pending**: employee outside ALL managed offices (manager must review)
- Records `approved_office_id` to track which office validated the clock-in

**Lateness Detection**  
- Compares current time to closest office's `ClockInTime` (format: "HH:MM")
- Calculates exact minutes late for reporting
- Still allows clock-in even if late (records lateness for review)

**Security**  
- JWT tokens with configurable expiry (default 24 hours, adjustable via System Settings)
- Role-based middleware: `AuthMiddleware()` + `ManagerMiddleware()`
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Super admin flag for elevated permissions (office creation/assignment)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Lokasi kantor belum diatur" error**
- **Solution**: Manager must configure office location first (Dashboard → Pengaturan Lokasi Kantor)

**CORS errors in browser console**
- **Check**: Backend allows `localhost:4200` by default (see [main.go](backend/main.go))
- **Production**: Update CORS to allow your domain

**Geolocation permission denied**
- **Solution**: Browser must have location permission enabled
- **Chrome**: Click lock icon in address bar → Allow location

**JWT token expired**
- **Behavior**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Solution**: User must log in again

**Database connection failed**
- **Check**: MySQL is running (`sudo systemctl status mysql`)
- **Verify**: Credentials in environment variables or default `root:password`
